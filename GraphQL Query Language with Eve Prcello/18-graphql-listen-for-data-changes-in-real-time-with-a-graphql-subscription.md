Instructor: 00:00 At this point, we've requested data with queries, we've changed data with mutations. There's one more operation type, though, with GraphQL. That is a GraphQL subscription. Let's say we wanted to set up a real-time listener for anytime a pet is returned.

00:16 The way that we would do this is to use a subscription. Let's close the schema, and in order to check in a pet, we have to check out a pet. In order to do either of those things, we have to be logged in. Let's make sure that we're logged in.

00:30 We're going to provide our username and our password, and now, I can log in.

The next thing I want to do is grab the token so that I can make myself an authorized user. I will add this to the HTTP headers under the authorization key. We'll add Bearer and paste the token.

00:50 The next step is I want to add a subscription. Let's add a new tab. We're going to add our subscription here. These, as we saw, are named just like queries and mutations. This time, it's going to be called petReturned.

01:03 The petReturned subscription returns something. What this returns is the checkout object. We have access to the pet, the checkout date, the check-in date, and whether or not the pet was late.

01:16 Here, we want to add the pet query, and then we'll add name.

As soon as I click play, we're going to notice some different behavior. This is listening for any changes, so it's not a request and a response. Instead, we're listening over a web socket.

01:30 Now, let's open up one final tab here. We're going to add a mutation for checkout, and the pet that I want to check out is going to be C-2. I'll get the pet and their name, then I'll change this to checkin to check-in the same pet.

01:46 Now, if I switch back to our subscription, we see that the petReturned subscription has heard some new data.

We've echoed back this checkout object. The GraphQL subscription is very useful. Whenever you have any real-time needs in your application, you're going to use a subscription. Then we can use a mutation to trigger that change.
